/*** Services:-
 Top level components like Activities.
 To perform long running operations in background.
 It does not need any user-interface.
 Handle network transactions, play musics, perform file I/O - all from the background.
 */

/*** ðŸ”¹ Types of Services:
 Foreground Service
   Runs with a notification to keep it alive.
   Used for things like music playback, fitness tracking, etc.
   Example: Spotify playing music in background.

 Background Service
   Runs silently in the background (limited by Android â‰¥ Oreo).
   For less-visible tasks like syncing data.
   Requires permission and usage limits on Android 8.0+.

 Bound Service
   Offers a client-server interface that components can bind to.
   Allows components (like activities) to interact with the service.
   Stops when all clients unbind.

ðŸ”¹ Life Cycle of a Service:
     onCreate(): Called once when the service is created.
     onStartCommand(): Called every time startService() is called.
     onBind(): Called when another component binds to the service using bindService().
     onDestroy(): Called when the service is no longer used.
